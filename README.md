# Jamie Quinn's Thesis

## Madoko

This thesis is written in [madoko](https://www.madoko.net/), a version of markdown specifically designed for academics writing papers including a lot of code and maths. It has various advantages over other scholarly markdown implementations such as
- theorem blocks
- nice code formatting
- ease of formatting using CSS
- simple conversion to presentations
- very simple to use

It is also much more natural to write in than latex, though it still reverts to latex syntax for typesetting maths.
