# Viscosity investigation

---

This is an investigation into the nature of viscosity in general and how it relates to the stress tensor. In particular, investigating the effect of a magnetic field on the viscosity is the ultimate aim. 

## TODO
[x] Read viscosity section in LARE manual
[x] Get to grips with stress tensor
[x] Calc divergence of Newtonian stress tensor in compressible fluid
[x] Investigate implementation of viscosity in LARE
[x] Write report detailing
  [x] viscosity tensor
  [x] Math & physical properties
  [x] What the stress tensor + viscosity mean
  [x] LARE implementation
