# Viscosity investigation

---

This is an investigation into the nature of viscosity in general and how it relates to the stress tensor. In particular, investigating the effect of a magnetic field on the viscosity is the ultimate aim. 

## TODO
[x] Read viscosity section in LARE manual
[] Get to grips with stress tensor
[] Calc divergence of Newtonian stress tensor in compressible fluid
[] Investigate implementation of viscosity in LARE
[] Write report detailing
  [] viscosity tensor
  [] Math & physical properties
  [] What the stress tensor + viscosity mean
  [] LARE implementation
